Steps to run this code 

1. No need to add any Server like Tomcat etc.
2. Server (Tomcat) plugin is present in pom.xml file
3. we need maven commnad to run this code and i.e  "clean install tomcat7:run" 
4. in pom.xml we define plugin for tomcat 7 i.e we use tomcat7:run in maven commnad.
5. Update Java Version in pom.xml file ( Java version of system and Java Version in pom should be same to run the code).
